# JS-PROJECT-1-INCREMENT-AND-DECREMENT TOOL
My JavaScript project is an increment and decrement tool that allows users to increase or decrease a value with just a click of a button. This is a very basic project that showcase my proficiency in the language that I learnt during my journey of learning JavaScript.

This simple JavaScript project provides an easy way to increment and decrement a value using buttons. The project offers a customizable user interface and provides a range of options to meet various use cases.

## Features
The increment and decrement tool provides the following features:

1. Increment and decrement values using buttons
2. Specify the step value for increment and decrement operations
3. Customizable styling using CSS

## How to Use
To use the increment and decrement tool, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The user interface will be displayed, allowing you to specify the initial value, minimum and maximum limits, and step value.

Once you've set your desired options, click the "Increment" or "Decrement" buttons to adjust the value. The value will be updated in real-time and displayed in the text box.

You can use the tool for various applications such as setting the quantity of products, managing inventory, and controlling numeric parameters in web applications.
